And the mome raths outgrabe.  
â€œBeware the Jabberwock, my son!

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem of your choice 8-20 lines,here!-->
When stretch'd on one's bed  
With a fierce-throbbing head,  
Which precludes alike thought or repose,  
How little one cares  
For the grandest affairs  
That may busy the world as it goes!  

How little one feels  
For the waltzes and reels  
Of our Dance-loving friends at a Ball!  
How slight one's concern  
To conjecture or learn  
What their flounces or hearts may befall.  

How little one minds  
If a company dines  
On the best that the Season affords!  
How short is one's muse  
O'er the Sauces and Stews,  
Or the Guests, be they Beggars or Lords.  

How little the Bells,  
Ring they Peels, toll they Knells,
